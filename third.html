<h1>Unit 1, Outcome 3 (Review) </h1>

<h1>Develop and test solutions to improve ongoing use of IT tools and systems </h1>

<h1>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? </h1>
   

<p>There is definitely huge benefit in using IT tools and systems in terms of productivity and efficiency as the tools I utilised assisted me in creating my website. VS Code assisted me in preparing and editing my code efficiently as it guides me through the process and highlights any errors for me to review and change. Without this it would have been a lot more difficult for me to do this.

        The organisation tool Trello assisted me in terms of productivity as I used this to organise my workload and manage my tasks effectively. It allowed me to prioritise my tasks and keep track of when tasks were completed or still needed doing using the Kanban method.
        
        In terms of improving productivity and efficiency I would have preferred to complete this task in teams as I would have then been able to delegate the workload  between my team mates allowing me to concentrate on managing the project as I feel this is my strength. I could have delegated tasks to other team members depending on their strengths which would have allowed us to complete the task more efficiently.
        </p>

<h1>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h1>

<p>I would have worked in teams to improve productivity and efficiency as it would have allowed the team members to work with their individual strengths which would have allowed the task to be completed more quickly and efficiently. 

        If we were woking as part of team there could have been further research carried out by an individual team member which could have added to the content of the website and researching other features that could have been used to improve our website. There are a plethora of additional features I could have used to add to my website but given the time constraints I had to complete the project to was impossible for me to research all of them and add them to my website.
        </p>

<h1>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h1>

<p>I would have definitely worked in a team if I had to complete a similar project in the future as it would have allowed us to improve productivity and improve our website a lot more. I would have continued to use VS Code to create the website and CSS to customise the site. I would also have continued to use Trello to manage and organise the project as I feel this is a highly effective tool. I would have also been able to keep track of what tasks each individual team member was completing  which would then allow them to update their progress for everyone to see in the team as everyone has access to it. 

        I would have also used a communication channel such as slack to communicate between the team members which would have visible to all the team members. This can also be used to provide regular updates and can even be used remotely on any device.</p>

<h1> 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </h1>

<p> In terms of testing I will ensure that all the features I have on my website work such as buttons which navigate to other pages or links. I will also review how the website is visible on other devices such as mobile phones and ensure that the content is legible. 

        HTML and CSS is fairly simple to run and test and also have built in features to create text allowing you to view what the content would look like before you implement the final version. This will allow me to run tests throughout the project to view what the site will look like. If there are any changes that need to be made I can easily do this through VS code.</p>
