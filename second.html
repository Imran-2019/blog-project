<h1>UNIT 1 OUTCOME 2</h1>   

<P>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</P>

<P>In order for me to to complete my digital project I needed to utilise several tools for me to achieve my outcome. I had to create a website and in doing so I used several tools in order to manage how my tasks were managed and how the actual content of my website was created.

        I firstly used Trello which is a management tool to organise my tasks and used this to keep track of my progress and prioritised my tasks. I have only been introduced to this recently but can honestly say that I am quite impressed with this tool and will be using this again in future projects.
        
        Visual Studio Code is what I used to write my code and input the content for my website. I utilised HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) to write the content of my website and then customised this using CSS (Cascading Style Sheet). As a first time user I found these quite straight forward to use even though there is quite a lot of content to take in. Generally speaking I was quite pleased with the tools I used as they provided me with a great foundation to create my website. There is of course a lot more I could have done to add to my website but given the time constraints the tools used were more than adequate to complete my task.
        </P>

<P>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello </P>

<P>The tools I used were appropriate for my digital project as they provided me with a great platform to create my website and also customise it in the way that I perceived. The content of my website was input using HTML and the website was then customised using CSS. As most websites still use HTML I am of the opinion that the tools I selected were more than appropriate for my project. 

        Trello again was a great tool to organise and manage my overall project allowing me the option to breakdown tasks using the cards feature and by using the Kanban method, I was able to further breakdown my tasks into to do, in progress and done. I was also able to add additional cards for additional information such as resources or any other tasks that may need completing.
        
        Overall the tools selected were definitely appropriate for my digital project.</P>


<P>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</P>


<P>In terms of my final project I am extremely pleased with the final result as I have achieved what I set out to do. I was able to input the theme I wanted to follow which was based on the Street Fighter game, and set up my pages as if it was in the process of starting the game on a console. I found this very rewarding and enjoyed the whole process. I aimed to make it as simple and smooth as possible,  ensuring that  navigating between pages was seamless and smooth. 

        I wanted to make the content of my website clear and legible and making sure there was no conflict with the background.
        
        I would have liked to make it more interactive by having an option to actually play the game but this would have made it a lot more complicated and given the time constraints, this would not have been feasible.</P>


<P> 2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</P>

<P>Further improvements I would have liked to make to my digital project would have been to make some of features standout more by adding more animations and maybe even some music playing in the background from the actual game. I would have liked to create a GIF of some game play such as two characters fighting and have this set as a background. (I may still do this so if I have please ignore this sentence). I have preferred to use flexbox to align some of the text to make it more stable as at one point I needed to move text by just creating spaces.</P>


<P> 2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</P>

<P>According to the assignment brief specifically outcome: 2.1 Preparing appropriate content for your site, I have conducted thorough research to collate the information to answer all the questions as these will be the used as the content for my website. The content will then be presented on my website for the user to read through and review.

        With regards to the assignment brief: 2.6 Error free pages that are fit for purpose, I will ensure that this is achieved by running tests to check for any errors or bugs. I will also make sure that this is fit for purpose by ensuring that the layout is compatible with my website.
        
        2.3 Select and using appropriate editing and formatting techniques for clarity and good navigation will mean that I have used a variety of editing and formatting tools to provide clarity and good navigation between my pages. This will be achieved by using margins and layout techniques to provide and excellent webpage with legible content.</P>
