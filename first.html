<p> 1.0 About Me</p>

<p>My name is Imran Awan and I am originally from London. I studied Law at university and have been working in the legal field for the last 3 and half years. I have decided to come to Codenation as I want a career change into the tech world and strongly believe that Codenation will be able to guide me through this using their experience and plethora of connections. I have completed the develop cyber course and am now in the process of completing the develop coding course. I can honestly say that Codenation has provided me with a great insight into what life would be like working in  tech based environment and I have enjoyed every moment of it, including the commute which is a very rare thing indeed.

<p>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business </p>

<p>The purpose of IT in modern business is pivotal to the day to day running of a successful business. IT plays a role in almost every aspect of a company from selling products, attracting new customers and even online security to determine how sensitive information  is managed and handled.
    IT is continuously evolving and it is important for businesses to keep up to date with the latest trends in order to ensure that are not missing any opportunities which may generate revenue.</p>
 <b></b>
 <p>Businesses utilize IT in a number of different contexts and for many different purposes. In other words, IT isn’t just computers. For example, telephones, radio equipment and VOIP services used for vocal communications are included under the IT umbrella. In the same way, peripherals such as printers, copiers, scanners and 3D printers are also considered part of a business’ IT systems.
    When most people think IT, they think of computers: desktop machines, laptops and mobile devices used by individuals to input and manipulate data, create digital documents, conduct research, and more. IT also includes the applications and executable programs that are installed on these devices to enable the user to complete the task at hand. Somewhat less obviously, IT may also include the costs associated with purchasing, configuring and maintaining the necessary hardware and equipment to keep the company’s IT systems operating smoothly. In these ways, IT has become critical to the global business community.

    <p>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? 
    </p>

    <p>In order to complete digital projects successfully there are plentiful methods, skills and resources available to ensuring the best outcome is achieved in the most effective manner. 

        Project management will need to be utilised to manage how the tasks are delegated and monitored. Trello can be used to organise the different stages of the project and how the tasks are going to delegated to complete the task. All stages of the project can be organised to reflect how and what needs to be completed and can also be updated once tasks have been completed.
        
        Knowledge or understanding of what the project involves which will require adequate research. Research is key to any project as this provides an insight into what is required for the project to be successfully completed. Research also allows an opportunity to see what all the competition is doing and ways to make your own individual project unique. 
        Slack or an alternative common channel to communicate between team members is an excellent method of creating a communication platform between the members involved in the project. The benefits of this are continuous updates can be sent for everyone to view. These platforms are accessible on almost any device including mobile phones so messages can be viewed remotely.

        <p>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board. </p>

        <p>I will plan and carry out my tasks using Trello specifically using the KanBan method. This breaks down my tasks into to do, in progress and done,. This will allow me to keep track of what tasks have been completed and what also needs to be done. I will need to continuously update Trello with new tasks as and when I have received the brief. This will allow me to prioritise my tasks and provide me with an excellent platform to remain organised. 

            I will also be able to additional cards for reference purposes so that I can keep track of my sources of information if I need to revert back to them.

            <p>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? </p>

            <p>An example of how risks may impact digital projects could how effectively it works on operating systems and whether it is compatible with the latest operating system. New and updated versions of operating systems are always being released by manufactures and it is important for developers who are working on a digital project to keep this in mind as failure to do so can impact digital projects drastically.

                Another risk that may impact digital projects is the lack of cross functional expertise. A digital project does not mean that only it only requires digital people. Every digital project should have experts who have business management skills as they are ultimately the ones who oversee and manage how a project is organised and conducted. This is where project manager is useful and the failure to utilise the services of one could make it more difficult to deliver the digital project which could lead to failure.
                
                Poor investment is another reason why digital projects fail as company’s tend to invest heavily on shiny new gadgets and not in the actual business or customer values. Without the customer all businesses as set up to fail so it is important to prioritise the core values of a business. However it is still important to have sufficient technology to compete the task at hand but the best thing to do would be to strike a balance between the two.  Again this is where the services of a good project manager would be useful.
                </p>

                <p>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</p>

                <p>Choosing the right technology for a digital project is extremely important for the execution of a project. Each IT system and software have unique features and functions which are used to carry out different tasks and objectives. Trello being an organisation tool which is highly effective in organising and allocating individual tasks within a team.

                    Depending on what project is being conducted, if this involves creating an application for a mobile operating system the app can be developed on either a native operating system such as one specific to an operating system or one that can be used across all platforms such as IOS and Android.</p>

                    <p>VS code is an effective source-code editor which can be used on almost all operating systems. From previous experience I would definitely use this tool as it provides an excellent platform for writing code in any language and can guide you through the process, highlighting when there are errors in the code or when something might need editing.</p>

                    <p>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control 
                    </p>

                    <p>Trello has helped me plan my outcome as it has allowed me to organise my tasks using the KanBan methodology allowing me to continuously be aware of what tasks are in the process of being completed and what still requires to be completed. It also allows me to prioritise my tasks in order of importance which again allows me to keep track of what will need completing.

                        VS Code will allow me to programme my script using HTML and then customise this with CSS. VS Code will allow me to achieve my outcomes as it allows me to script my website with the relevant content in an easy to use, friendly platform which makes more convenient editing my text rather than actually trying to do this in HTML.
                        
                        Gitihub will assist me with my project as it tracks changes in my code across versions which means that Github keeps track of all the changes that have been pushed to the repository similar to Google Drive. This means that previous versions are not lost with every iteration.

                        <p>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? </p>

                        <p>GDPR impacts digital projects as it governs mainly how data is managed by companies.

                            The regulation has a number of aims all designed to increase and standardise the protection of individuals including, data portability, the right to be forgotten, the right to prevent profiling, the right to object to processing, the right to rectification and erasure, subject access requests.
                            While GDPR requires you to define data retention and deletion schedules for all the personal data you hold, it does not require you to delete everything as a rule. You may, for example, wish to keep all purchasing records for ten years for tax and auditing purposes. That is perfectly acceptable, as long as you document that fact and its rationale. A user’s request for account deletion would not require you to delete their purchasing records from your tax and accounting records; the right to be forgotten is not the right to fly under the radar.
